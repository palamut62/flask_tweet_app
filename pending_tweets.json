      "content": "Meta ispartnering with Midjourneyto license the startup‚Äôs AI image and video generation technology, Meta Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang announced Friday in a post on Threads. Wang says Meta‚Äôs research teams will collaborate with Midjourney to bring its technology into future AI models and products.‚ÄúTo ensure Meta is able to deliver the best possible products for people it will require taking an all-of-the-above approach,‚Äù Wang said. ‚ÄúThis means world-class talent, ambitious compute roadmap, and working with the best players across the industry.‚ÄùThe Midjourney partnership could help Meta develop products that compete with industry-leading AI image and video models, such as OpenAI‚Äôs Sora, Black Forest Lab‚Äôs Flux, and Google‚Äôs Veo. Last year,Meta rolled out its own AI image generation tool, Imagine, into several of its products, including Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. Meta also has an AI video generation tool, Movie Gen,that allows users to create videos from prompts.The licensing agreement with Midjourney marks Meta‚Äôs latest deal to get ahead in the AI race. Earlier this year, CEOMark Zuckerberg went on a hiring spree for AI talent, offering some researchers compensation packages worth upwards of $100 million. The social media giant also invested$14 billionin Scale AI, andacquiredthe AI voice startup Play AI.Meta has held talks with several other leading AI labs about other acquisitions, and Zuckerberg even spoke with Elon Musk aboutjoining his $97 billion takeover bid of OpenAI(Meta ultimately did not join the offer, and OpenAI denied Musk‚Äôs bid).While the terms of Meta‚Äôs deal with Midjourney remain unknown, the startup‚Äôs CEO, David Holz, said in apost on Xthat his company remains independent with no investors; Midjourney is one of the few leading AI model developers that has never taken on outside funding. At one point, Meta talked with Midjourney aboutacquiring the startup, according to Upstarts Media.Midjourney was founded in 2022 and quickly became a leader",
