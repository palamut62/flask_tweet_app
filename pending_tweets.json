      "content": "Meta ispartnering with Midjourneyto license the startup‚Äôs AI image and video generation technology, Meta Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang announced Friday in a post on Threads. Wang says Meta‚Äôs research teams will collaborate with Midjourney to bring its technology into future AI models and products.‚ÄúTo ensure Meta is able to deliver the best possible products for people it will require taking an all-of-the-above approach,‚Äù Wang said. ‚ÄúThis means world-class talent, ambitious compute roadmap, and working with the best players across the industry.‚ÄùThe Midjourney partnership could help Meta develop products that compete with industry-leading AI image and video models, such as OpenAI‚Äôs Sora, Black Forest Lab‚Äôs Flux, and Google‚Äôs Veo. Last year,Meta rolled out its own AI image generation tool, Imagine, into several of its products, including Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. Meta also has an AI video generation tool, Movie Gen,that allows users to create videos from prompts.The licensing agreement with Midjourney marks Meta‚Äôs latest deal to get ahead in the AI race. Earlier this year, CEOMark Zuckerberg went on a hiring spree for AI talent, offering some researchers compensation packages worth upwards of $100 million. The social media giant also invested$14 billionin Scale AI, andacquiredthe AI voice startup Play AI.Meta has held talks with several other leading AI labs about other acquisitions, and Zuckerberg even spoke with Elon Musk aboutjoining his $97 billion takeover bid of OpenAI(Meta ultimately did not join the offer, and OpenAI denied Musk‚Äôs bid).While the terms of Meta‚Äôs deal with Midjourney remain unknown, the startup‚Äôs CEO, David Holz, said in apost on Xthat his company remains independent with no investors; Midjourney is one of the few leading AI model developers that has never taken on outside funding. At one point, Meta talked with Midjourney aboutacquiring the startup, according to Upstarts Media.Midjourney was founded in 2022 and quickly became a leader",

We need you to all learn it and at least onboard. You don‚Äôt have to use it every day yet until we do some training, but at least onboard by the end of the week. And if not, I‚Äôm hosting a meeting on Saturday with everybody who hasn‚Äôt done it and I‚Äôd like to meet with you to understand why.‚Äô‚ÄùAt the meeting, some people had reasonable explanations for not getting their AI assistant accounts set up during the week, like being on vacation, Armstrong said.‚ÄúI jumped on this call on Saturday and there were a couple people that had not done it. Some of them had a good reason, because they were just getting back from some trip or something, and some of them didn‚Äôt [have a good reason]. And they got fired.‚ÄùArmstrong admits that it was a ‚Äúheavy-handed approach‚Äù and there were people in the company who ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt like it.‚ÄùTechcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil ‚Äî just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

      "content": "As AI technology makes its way into the enterprise, Apple is rolling out new tools that will give businesses more granular control over where and how their employees can tap into artificial intelligence. With the release of Apple‚Äôs software updates arriving in September, the tech giant is adding another option for enterprise customers: the ability to configure the use of an enterprise version of OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT.Apple has already seen the demand forChatGPT for Enterprise, which OpenAI says now has over 5 million business customers. These companies use the AI service to connect with their own internal data when using AI agents.However, what‚Äôs interesting about the way Apple‚Äôs integration with ChatGPT for Enterprise has been structured is that it‚Äôs not hard-coded to only restrict or allow ChatGPT itself.Instead, Apple‚Äôs support documents indicate that IT administrators will be able to restrict or allow any ‚Äúexternal‚Äù artificial intelligence provider, not just OpenAI‚Äôs technology. That leaves the door open for Apple to forge other deals with large AI players used in the enterprise environment, without having to recode things at the protocol level.As Apple has rolled out new AI features aimed at its devices‚Äô end users ‚Äî like writing tools or visual intelligence, for example ‚Äî it‚Äôs also rolled out ways for IT departments to control access to those features.While the company fully believes in its Private Cloud Compute architecture, it knows that it can take time for companies to agree to make changes to sensitive systems and data. That‚Äôs why it leaves it up to businesses to decide if data should be processed in the cloud or on the device, for example.In addition to letting businesses pick and choose which AI features to enable, this setup allows businesses to decide whether employees‚Äô AI requests can go to ChatGPT‚Äôs cloud service, even when the business doesn‚Äôt have its own enterprise deal with OpenAI.
