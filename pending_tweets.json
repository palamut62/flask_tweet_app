      "content": "Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI President Greg Brockman are among the Silicon Valley veterans putting more than $100 million into a network of political action committees (PACs) that will advocate against strict AI regulations in next year‚Äôs midterm elections, reportsThe Wall Street Journal.The new pro-AI super-PAC network dubbed ‚ÄúLeading the Future‚Äù aims to use campaign donations and digital ads to advocate for favorable AI regulation and oppose candidates that the group thinks will stifle the industry.Both Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI were part of a push earlier this year to implement a10-year moratoriumon states‚Äô rights to create their own AI regulations. The ban wasultimately struck down, but the AI industry continues to fight against a ‚Äúpatchwork of regulations,‚Äù which they say would slow down innovation and put the U.S. at risk of losing the AI race to China.The group hopes to model its approach on pro-crypto super-PAC network Fairshake, which helped cement a victory for Donald Trump. It will generally align with thepolicies of White HouseAI and crypto czar David Sacks, per The Journal.Got a sensitive tip or confidential documents?
