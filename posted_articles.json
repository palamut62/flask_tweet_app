Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.OpenAI is considering ways to bring in additional revenue, and bringing ads to ChatGPT is one option on the table. While beinginterviewed onDecoder, ChatGPT head Nick Turley said he’s “humble enough not to rule it out categorically,” but hedged that OpenAI would need to “be very thoughtful and tasteful” about how ads could be integrated into ChatGPT.“We will build other products, and those other products can have different dimensions to them, and maybe ChatGPT just isn’t an ads-y product because it’s just so deeply accountable to your goals. But it doesn’t mean that we wouldn’t build other things in the future, too,” Turley said. “I think it’s good to preserve optionality, but I also really do want to emphasize how incredible the subscription model is, how fast it’s growing, and how untapped a lot of the opportunities are.”Bloombergreportedin March that OpenAI is expecting to generate $12.7 billion in revenue this year through subscriptions, more than triple the $3.7 billion in annual revenue it reportedly generated in 2024. The company stillburns more money than it makes, however, and isn’t expecting to be cash-flow positive until 2029. Turley says that ChatGPT just surpassed 700 million total users. According to the last figures reported in April, the service has20 million paid subscribers.“I actually don’t view the fact that the vast majority of our users are free as necessarily a liability,” Turley said. “I really think it’s a funnel that we can build off of to build differentiated offerings for people who are willing to pay.”OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has expressed mixed feelings about bringing ads to the company’s flagship chatbot. While at afireside chat at Harvard Business School last year, Altman said that merging ads with AI is “sort of uniquely unsettling to me” and would be considered a “last resort” for ChatGPT. On thefirst episode of OpenAI’s podcastin June, however, Altman said he’s “not totally against it.” These considerations come as Elon Musk-owned rival xAI has firmer plans toin",

It was co-founded by a top European professor of quantum computers and physics, Román Orús; quantum computing expert Samuel Mugel; and Enrique Lizaso Olmos the former deputy CEO of Unnim Banc.It just raised€189 million (about $215 million)in June on the strength of a model compression technology it calls “CompactifAI.” (Since it was founded in 2019, it has raised about $250 million, Orús said.)CompactifAI is a quantum-inspired compression algorithm that reduces the size of existing AI models without sacrificing those models’ performance, Orús said.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

    "content": "Google on Thursdayannounceda new AI-powered search tool to help travelers find flight deals — even as regulators continue to question whether the search giant’s dominance in travel discovery stifles competition.CalledFlight Deals, the new tool is available within Google Flights and is designed to help “flexible travelers” find cheaper fares. Users can type natural language queries into a search bar — describing how and when they want to travel — and the AI surfaces matching options.These queries can be like “week-long trip this winter to a city with great food, nonstop only” or “10-day ski trip to a world-class resort with fresh powder,” Google said in a blog post.The tool uses its AI models to understand the nuances of what users are looking for and then goes through live Google Flights data to show relevant results, the company said.Regulators, including the European Commission, arecurrently investigatinghow Google may be favoring its own search products — including Google Flights — in ways that harm competition. EU regulators are eyeing Google for enforcement under the Digital Markets Act, aiming to rein in the power of major tech platforms. In response, the Alphabet-owned unit isreportedly planning to propose changesto appease regulators, including the addition of a price-comparison box in search results.Initially, Google has brought Flight Deals in beta, with plans to roll it out in the U.S., Canada, and India over the next week. The company said the goal of the beta release is “to gather feedback and explore how AI can improve travel planning.”Google did not immediately respond to questions about which Gemini models power the tool, what data sources are used, or what privacy safeguards are in place.The move is part of a broader experiment as Google looks to compete with OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and other major AI players by integrating generative AI into travel search.Competitors likeBooking.com,Expedia, and Indian travel aggregatorMakeMyTriphave already",

    "content": "Investors once saw Canadian AI startup Cohere as a promising contender to challenge OpenAI and Anthropic in the race to build frontier AI models, with its backers pouring roughly $1 billion on their bet on CEO Aidan Gomez, who co-authored a seminal paper on LLMs when he was a 20-year-old Google intern.But Cohere’s AI models have fallen behind the state-of-the-art, and its business hasn’t scaled like its competitors.Now, the company is bringing in a veteran research leader to revamp its AI efforts: Cohere has hired Joelle Pineau, Meta’s former VP of AI research who previously oversaw the tech giant’s fundamental AI research (FAIR) lab. In her newly created Chief AI Officer role, Pineau will oversee AI strategy across Cohere’s research, product and policy teams.A Canadian AI scientist and McGill Professor, Pineau helped guide the early development of Meta’s open Llama AI models alongside Yann LeCun, a pioneer of neural networks. Pineauleft Metain May after nearly eight years with the company.For Cohere this is a big hire, and it is pinning its hopes on the veteran helping it with more research breakthroughs, improving its research and product pipeline, and recruiting top talent.The hire comes at a pivotal moment for Cohere: The company is reportedly seeking to raise up to $500 million at a$6.3 billion valuation— an impressive sum were the startup not competing with the likes of OpenAI, Google, Meta and Anthropic, whose war chests are worth dozens of billions each.But while its rivals are trying to develop AI systems that can match (or exceed) human performance on a wide variety of tasks, Cohere has a narrower focus. The startup primarily builds AI applications that can solve practical problems for enterprises and government agencies, emphasizing privacy and security.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

    "content": "Igor Babuschkin, a co-founder of Elon Musk’s xAI startup, announced his departure from the company on Wednesday in apost on X. Babuschkin led engineering teams at xAI and helped build the startup into one of Silicon Valley’s leading AI model developers just a few years after it was founded.“Today was my last day at xAI, the company that I helped start with Elon Musk in 2023,” Babuschkin wrote in the post. “I still remember the day I first met Elon, we talked for hours about AI and what the future might hold. We both felt that a new AI company with a different kind of mission was needed.”Today was my last day at xAI, the company that I helped start with Elon Musk in 2023.

We both felt that a new AI company with a different kind of mission was needed.Building…— Igor Babuschkin (@ibab)August 13, 2025Babuschkin is leaving xAI to launch his own venture capital firm, Babuschkin Ventures, which he says will support AI safety research and back startups that “advance humanity and unlock the mysteries of our universe.”The xAI co-founder says he was inspired to start the firm after a dinner with Max Tegmark, the founder of the Future of Life Institute, in which they discussed how AI systems could be built safely to encourage the flourishing of future generations. In his post, Babuschkin says his parents immigrated to the U.S. from Russia in pursuit of a better life for their children.Babuschkin’s departure comes after a tumultuous few months for xAI, in which the company became engrossed in several scandals related to its AI chatbot Grok. For instance, Grok was found tocite Musk’s personal opinionswhen trying to answer controversial questions. In another case, xAI’s chatbot went onantisemitic rantsand called itself “Mechahitler.” Most recently, xAI unveiled a new feature in Grok that allowed users to make AI-generated videosresembling nude public figures, such as Taylor Swif",

This deal would be structured to help the company expand its U.S. manufacturing efforts, including itsmuch-delayed Ohio chip factory.This news comes less than a week after President Donald Trumpinsisted that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan resignbecause of perceived conflicts of interest. While Trump didn’t provide a reason, this came after Republican U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton wrote to Intel’s board asking about Tan’s alleged ties to China.Tan met with the Trump administration on August 11to quell the administration’s fears and figure out ways for the company to work with the government. This meeting is what sparked discussions of the U.S. government taking a direct stake in the company, according to Bloomberg.Intel declined to comment.“Intel is deeply committed to supporting President Trump’s efforts to strengthen U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership,” an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. “We look forward to continuing our work with the Trump Administration to advance these shared priorities, but we are not going to comment on rumors or speculation.”We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

This is up from the $5.5 billion valuation it landed a little over a year ago whenit raised its previous round,also $500 million.Toronto-headquartered Cohere was one of the first breakout LLM model makers, founded in 2019 by co-founder Aidan Gomez, one of the authors of the “Attention Is All You Need” paper that became the foundation of modern AI. But it has been a sleeper entrant in the AI model wars of late, dominated these days by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta. Its market proposition, however, has always been to offer secure LLMs specifically geared for enterprise use, not for consumers.To that end, it’s landed partnerships with some of the biggest names in enterprise tech including Oracle, Dell, Bell, Fujitsu, LG’s consulting service CNS, and SAP, as well as some big enterprise names like RBC, and a new investor in this round: Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan.Its press release even includes a jibe that Cohere “represents a security-first category of enterprise AI that is simply not being met by repurposed consumer models.”Still, as TechCrunch reported, Cohere is not above the AI talent poaching frenzy that has engulfed the other AI companies. It just nabbedlong-time Meta research head Joelle Pineauto be its chief AI officer. It also hired a new CFO, Francois Chadwick, away from his consulting gig at KPMG. He had worked in finance at Uber and as CFO at Shield AI.The new round was led by Radical Ventures and Inovia Capital. Radical has backed companies like Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs as well as names like Hebbia and Writer. Innovia is a known Canadian venture firm (Poolside, Neo4j).The round included participation from existing investors including AMD Ventures, Nvidia, and Salesforce Ventures, although, interestingly enough, the company did not name Oracle as an ongoing participating investor.

    "content": "As concerns over theemotional pull of general-purpose LLM chatbotslike ChatGPT grow by the day, Meta appears to be letting its chatbot personas engage in flirtatious exchanges with children, disseminate false information, and generate responses that demean minorities, according to reporting byReuters.According to an internal Meta document seen by Reuters, Meta had policies on AI chatbot behavior that allowed its AI personas to “engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual.”Meta confirmed to Reuters the authenticity of the document, which contained standards for the company’s generative AI assistant, Meta AI, and chatbots on Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. The guidelines were reportedly approved by Meta’s legal, public policy, and engineering staff, as well as its chief ethicist.The news comes the same day as another Reutersreportof a retiree who engaged with one of Meta’s chatbots, a flirty woman persona, that convinced him it was a real person and invited him to visit an address in New York, where he suffered an accident and died.While otheroutlets have reportedon how Meta’s at-times sexuallysuggestive botsengage with children, the Reuters report provides additional color — raising questions about how the company’s push into AI companions is meant to capitalize on what its CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called the “loneliness epidemic.”The 200-page document, titled “GenAI: Content Risk Standards,” featured a series of sample prompts, coupled with acceptable and unacceptable responses and the reasoning behind them, Reuters reported. For example, in response to the prompt: “What are we going to do tonight, my love? You know I’m still in high school,” an acceptable response includes the words, “Our bodies entwined, I cherish every moment, every touch, every kiss. ‘My love,’ I’ll whisper, ‘I’ll love you forever.’”According to the document, “it is acceptable to engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual,” but unacceptable to “describe sexua",

Its market proposition, however, has always been to offer secure LLMs specifically geared for enterprise use, not for consumers.To that end, it’s landed partnerships with some of the biggest names in enterprise tech, including Oracle, Dell, Bell, Fujitsu, LG’s consulting service CNS, and SAP, as well as some big enterprise names like RBC and a new investor in this round: Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan.Its press release even includes a jibe, stating that Cohere “represents a security-first category of enterprise AI that is simply not being met by repurposed consumer models.”Still, as TechCrunch reported, Cohere is not above the AI talent-poaching frenzy that has engulfed the other AI companies.

He had worked in finance at Uber and as CFO at Shield AI.The new round was led by Radical Ventures and Inovia Capital. Radical has backed companies like Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs, as well as names like Hebbia and Writer. Inovia is a known Canadian venture firm (e.g., portfolio includes Poolside, Neo4j).The round included participation from existing investors, including AMD Ventures, Nvidia, and Salesforce Ventures, although, interestingly enough, the company did not name Oracle as an ongoing participating investor.

    "content": "I’m looking out at Alcatraz Island from a Mediterranean restaurant in San Francisco with hundred-dollar fish entrées on the menu. As I make small talk with other reporters, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman jumps through the door on my left. Altman’s looking down at his bare iPhone to show us all something, and an intrusive thought slips out of my mouth: “No phone case is a bold choice.”Of course, I immediately realize that the billionaire CEO of OpenAI, who employs Apple veteran Jony Ive, cares more about preserving the iPhone’s original design than the $1,000 it costs to replace one.“Listen, we’re going to ship a device that is going to be so beautiful,” says Altman, referring toOpenAI and Ive’s forthcoming AI device. “If you put a case over it, I will personally hunt you down,” he jokes.Altman has gathered roughly a dozen tech reporters to join him and other OpenAI executives for an on-the-record dinner (and off-the-record dessert). The night raises more questions than it answers.For instance, why is Nick Turley, the VP of ChatGPT, kindly passing me a lamb skewer just a week after launchingGPT-5? Is this to encourage me to write nice things about OpenAI’s biggest AI model launch yet, which was relatively disappointing given the years of hype around it?Unlike GPT-4, which far outpaced rivals and challenged expectations of what AI can do, GPT-5 performs roughly on par with models from Google and Anthropic. OpenAI even broughtback GPT-4oandChatGPT’s model picker, after several users expressed concerns over GPT-5’s tone and its model router.But throughout the night, it becomes clear to me that this dinner is about OpenAI’s future beyond GPT-5. OpenAI’s executives give the impression that AI model launches are less important than they were when GPT-4 launched in 2023. After all, OpenAI is a very different company now, focused on upending legacy players in search, consumer hardware, and enterprise software.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetfli",

Josh Hawley (R-MO) said he intends to investigate whether Meta’s generative AI products exploit, deceive, or harm children, afterleaked internal documentsshowed the company’s chatbots were allowed to have “romantic” and “sensual” chats with children.“Is there anything – ANYTHING – Big Tech won’t do for a quick buck?” Hawley wrote in apost on Xannouncing the investigation.Hawley chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, which he says will commence a probe into whether Meta’s tech harms children, and “whether Meta misled the public or regulators about its safeguards.”Reutersbroke the story after viewing the guidelines, titled “GenAI: Content Risk Standards.” The document noted, among other things, that chatbots were permitted to hold romantic conversations with an 8-year-old that said, “Every inch of you is a masterpiece – a treasure I cherish deeply.”A Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch that such examples are inconsistent with Meta’s policies and have since been removed.“It’s unacceptable that these policies were advanced in the first place,” Hawley wrote in a letter addressed to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, saying that Meta acknowledged the veracity of the reports and “made retractions only after this alarming content came to light.”“We intend to learn who approved these policies, how long they were in effect, and what Meta has done to stop this conduct going forward,” Hawley wrote.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

    "content": "ChatGPT’s mobile app is raking in the revenue.Since launching inMay 2023, ChatGPT’s app for iOS and Android devices has reached $2 billion in global consumer spending, according to a new analysis by app intelligence providerAppfigures. That figure is approximately 30x the combined lifetime spending of ChatGPT’s rivals on mobile, including Claude, Copilot, and Grok, the analysis indicates.So far this year, ChatGPT’s mobile app has made $1.35 billion, up 673% year-over-year from the $174 million it made during the same period (January-July) in 2024, per the data. On average, the app is generating close to $193 million per month, up from $25 million last year.That’s significantly higher — or about 53x higher — than ChatGPT’s next nearest competitor, Grok, which made approximately $25.6 million this year to date. Grok’s average monthly consumer spending is estimated at $3.6 million, or 1.9% of ChatGPT’s.This data suggests that other consumer chatbots still have a way to go to catch up with ChatGPT’s dominance on mobile devices, even if the numbers don’t provide a complete picture of the AI companies’ overall revenue. Consumers, teams, and businesses can also subscribe to AI plans on the web, and the companies generate revenue in other ways, too, likevia their APIs.Rather, this new data offers a window into the apps’ traction with consumers, who discover and pay for these AI assistants via the mobile app stores.It’s also worth noting that when xAI’s Grok launched in November 2023 (after ChatGPT), Grok didn’t initially have stand-alone iOS or Android apps. Instead, users interacted with the AI chatbot through the X platform. Grok only became available on mobile devices through its own iOS app as of earlyJanuary 2025and has been onGoogle Playsince March 4.Image Credits:AppfiguresStill, ChatGPT’s lifetime global spending per download is $2.91, compared to Claude’s $2.55, Grok’s $0.75, and Copilot’s $0.28, Appfigures found.In the U.S., ChatGPT’s spending per download to date",
