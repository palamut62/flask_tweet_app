    "content": "At this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC 25), Apple announced a slew of updates to its operating systems, services, and software, including a new look it dubbed “Liquid Glass” and a rebranded naming convention. Apple was notably quiet on one highly anticipated product: a more personalized, AI-powered Siri, which it first introduced at last year’s conference.Apple’s SVP of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi, only gave the Siri update a brief mention during the keynote address, saying, “As we’ve shared, we’re continuing our work to deliver the features that make Siri even more personal. This work needed more time to reach our high-quality bar, and we look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year.”The time frame of “coming year” seems to indicate that Apple won’t have news before 2026. That’s a significant delay in the AI era, where new models, updates, and upgrades ship at a rapid pace.First announced at WWDC 24, themore personalized Siriis expected to bring artificial intelligence updates to the beleaguered virtual assistant built into iPhone and other Apple devices. At the time, the company hyped it as the “next big step for Apple” and said Siri would be able to understand your “personal context,” like your relationships, communications, routine, and more.Plus, the assistant was going to be more useful by allowing you to take action within and across your apps.While Bloombergreportedthat the in-development version of the more personalized Siri was functional, it was not consistently working properly. The report said its quality issues meant Siri only performed as it should two-thirds of the time, making it not viable to ship.Apple officially announced in March it waspushing back the launch, saying the Siri update would take longer to deliver than anticipated. The company also pulled SVP of Machine Learning and AI Strategy John Giannandrea off the Siri project andput Mike Rockwell, who had worked on the Vision Pro, in charge.The shake-up ind",

With visionOS 26, they become spatial, integrating into your space. You can customize the widgets to the size, color, and depth you like, and place them where you want.New widgets include a clock that you can decorate, weather that adapts to the weather outside near you, music for quick access to tunes, and photos that can transform into a panorama or a “window to another space.”Adding depth to 2D imagesImage Credits:AppleAn update to the visionOS Photos app uses a new AI algorithm that leverages computational depth to create multiple perspectives for your 2D photos, bringing images to life. Apple says it will feel like you can “lean right into them and look around.”Spatial browsing on Safari can also make web browsing a more immersive experience. With certain supported articles, spatial browsing can hide distractions and reveal inline photos that “come alive as you scroll.” Developers can also add spatial browsing to their own apps.Talking headsWith VisionOS 26, Personas are transformed to feel more natural and familiarImage Credits:AppleApple released Personas, an AI avatar to represent you on video calls, on the Vision Pro as a beta feature last year.

    "content": "At WWDC 2025, Appleshowedoff a new AI-powered Shortcuts app.The company says Shortcuts can now tap into Apple Intelligence directly, and developers will be able to access Apple’s on-device large language model (LLM).With Shortcuts, users will be able to access the AI models either on device or with Private Compute to generate responses that feed into the rest of their shortcut. For instance, a student could create a shortcut that uses AI to compare their audio transcription of their class lecture to their notes, then add key points they missed. They can also tap into ChatGPT to provide further responses that feed into their shortcut’s input.Users will be able to tap into intelligent actions, which are a new type of shortcut that’s enabled by Apple Intelligence. For instance, there are dedicated actions like those for summarizing text with AI (Apple Intelligence’s Writing Tools) or creating images with Image Playground.Apple says the new features are available for testing starting Monday.The AI-assisted Shortcuts app follows the company’sannouncement last year ofan AI-enhanced upgrade to its virtual assistant Siri, offering more personalized features and support. However, Apple thenpushed back the launch, saying it would take longer to deliver than anticipated.At WWDC 2025, the companycontinuedto make AI promises, including the introduction of an updated version of its Shortcuts app for scripting and automation.Techcrunch eventSave $200+ on your TechCrunch All Stage passBuild smarter.

    "content": "OpenAI haslaunchedo3-pro, an AI model that the company claims is its most capable yet.O3-pro is a version of OpenAI’so3, a reasoning model that the startup launched earlier this year. As opposed to conventional AI models, reasoning models work through problems step by step, enabling them to perform more reliably in domains like physics, math, and coding.O3-pro is available for ChatGPT Pro and Team users starting Tuesday, replacing theo1-promodel. Enterprise and Edu users will get access the week after, OpenAI says. O3-pro is also live in OpenAI’s developer API as of this afternoon.O3-pro is priced at $20 per million input tokens and $80 per million output tokens in the API. Input tokens are tokens fed into the model, while output tokens are tokens that the model generates based on the input tokens.A million input tokens is equivalent to about 750,000 words, a bit longer than “War and Peace.”OpenAI o3-pro is available in the model picker for Pro and Team users starting today, replacing OpenAI o1-pro.Enterprise and Edu users will get access the week after.As o3-pro uses the same underlying model as o3, full safety details can be found in the o3 system card.…— OpenAI (@OpenAI)June 10, 2025“In expert evaluations, reviewers consistently prefer o3-pro over o3 in every tested category and especially in key domains like science, education, programming, business, and writing help,” OpenAI writes in a changelog. “Reviewers also rated o3-pro consistently higher for clarity, comprehensiveness, instruction-following, and accuracy.”O3-pro has access to tools, according to OpenAI, allowing it to search the web, analyze files, reason about visual inputs, use Python, personalize its responses leveraging memory, and more. As a drawback, the model’s responses typically take longer than o1-pro to complete, according to OpenAI.Techcrunch eventSave $200+ on your TechCrunch All Stage passBuild smarter. Scale faster.
